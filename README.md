# hello-world
Hello world project, obviously the first one in GitHub.
I am learning GitHub at the moment, but the objective is to develop some proficiency in coding so that I can apply for developer positions.  
I always wanted to be a programmer, that is why I studied Visual Basic and C++ back in the nineties.
